##      AKANE RWM DESCRIPTION

  Before starting off, note this: <br />
  Akane is not a Mod, Module or a ROM. It's a RWM, an Read-Write-Memory Package which works as optimization on ROMs. <br />
  
  This Project is aiming on the higest possible Quality in all Edges of a Android OS. Based on Years of research, testing and balancing.
  RWM is an Extension which can be installed on top of any ROM running on Xiaomi Devices. MIUI or AOSP, Your Choice! Select Your Favorite ROM,
  flash it together with the Akane RWM and give Your Device a complete overhaul under the UI. We don't give You fancy UI Features or Toggles.
  We optimize Your Favorite ROM with Your beloved UI and we will take care of the Quality behind the Scenes. You will also explore extra functions
  in the Settings of Your ROMs and Apps, a better overall Audio In-/Output Quality on all Sources, better Connectivity over all Connections,
  unlocked Device and Android Features, a absolutely fluid and performant OS and so much more. The List is growing nonstop,

##      GITHUB NIGHTLY INSTRUCTIONS

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Miustone/akane/blob/master/github.png"></p>
You can get Nightly Builds from the AKANE RWM by downloading the Master Branch Zip from GitHub to a Device,
or follow the Link on the top of the GitHub Page to get Release Candidates with included GApps and other Extras.
Before You can use Nightlies, is it essential to repack the Patch correctly. In order to do that extract the downloaded Zip File.
You will get a Folder which contains all the Files of the Patch. Go inside of this Folder and pack all Files into a compressed standard Zip.
I recommend 7zip/Bandizip on Windows and Rar on Android to do that.
