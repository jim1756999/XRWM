<h1 align="center">XIAOMI AOSP SNAPDRAGON PATCH</h1>

* Editor's note: Yes, I know there's plenty of spelling mistakes, and that your head might start to hurt by reading this, I am working on it.

##      PATCH DESCRIPTION

  Before starting off, note this:
  This is not a mod or a ROM. It's a patch, an extension to the android itself. It is a work of time that needs to be taken seriously. <br />
  XASP does what no one has, it gives the word "fluid" a new name, it is yet to make its name everywhere. <br />
  It adds cutting-edge optimalizations, configurations, libraries and applications, while maintaining maximum stability - it is everything a flagship needs. <br /> 
  So: Why do you restrict yourself with basic AOSP ROMs? <br />
	  Why do you need mods, modules, when xasp has everything? <br />
	  Why use anything else? <br />
	  XASP is here to change. <br />
  Pixel Experience for AOSP roms, behind-the-scenes madness for MIUI roms. <br />
  Level up your experience, get the most out of your baby. <br />
  Optimal, stable, pure. <br />
  Welcome to xasp.  <br />
  
  
##      PATCH REQUIREMENTS

##### An Android device running Android 9.0 (AOSP ARM64 or MIUI ARM64)
